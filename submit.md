======
<p>======</p>

<p></p>
Please read the submission guidelines below very carefully.

Any pieces which do not follow the rules will be rejected.

We especially encourage submissions from people from groups which are underrepresented in tech.

We will not consider work with sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, ableist, or otherwise bigoted content.
<p></p>
What we are looking for
<p>-----------------------</p>
<p></p>
Any kind of <span class="has-text-info">art</span> where <span class="has-text-primary">code</span> is the medium.

The artistic qualities can be aesthetic, technical, emotional, or whatever else you can come up with.

We want pieces which surprise us and challenge our notions of both <span class="has-text-primary">code</span> and <span class="has-text-info">art</span>.

Any programming language may be used, even esoteric languages or ones which don't exist yet. You may also mix languages within a piece.

Your <span class="has-text-primary">code</span> does *not* need to compile or run. It might not even be text: feel free to submit images.

For some ideas, have a look at [code {poems}](http://code-poems.com), [Source Code Poetry](https://www.sourcecodepoetry.com/), and [./code --poetry](http://code-poetry.com/), but do not limit yourself to the styles which are featured in these places.

<p></p>
Submission guidelines:
<p></p>
\* Submit *at most* three pieces by email to [codeartjournal@gmail.com](mailto:codeartjournal@gmail.com).

\* Each piece must fit on a page of A5 paper. Text will be rendered in Fira Code 10pt unless specified by you.

\* Pieces must be submitted in .doc, .docx, .txt, .pdf, or image format. Do not send archives. Ideally send only one file with all of your pieces.

\* Do not include any identifying information in your submitted document or its title.

\* Authors must hold the copyright of the submitted <span class="has-text-primary">code</span>.
<p></p>
We intend to respond to all submissions within a month of the submission deadline.

Authors of selected pieces will be given a contributors copy.
