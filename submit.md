What we are looking for
<p>-----------------------</p>
<p></p>
Any kind of <span class="has-text-info">art</span> where <span class="has-text-primary">code</span> is the medium.

The artistic qualities can be aesthetic, technical, emotional, or whatever else you can come up with.

We want pieces which surprise us and challenge our notions of both <span class="has-text-primary">code</span> and <span class="has-text-info">art</span>.

<p></p>
Submission guidelines:
<p></p>
\* Submit *at most* three <span class="has-text-primary">code</span> snippets.

\* Snippets are limited to 45 columns by 31 lines.

\* All pieces must be in a single document.

\* Acceptable formats: .doc, .docx, .md, .txt.

\* Pieces must be clearly separated and titled.

\* Any programming language may be used (preferably real ones, but not necessarily).

\* You may mix languages within a piece.

\* Do not include any identifying information in your submitted document or its title.

\* Authors must hold the copyright of the submitted <span class="has-text-primary">code</span>.
<p></p>
We intend to respond to all submissions within a month of the submission deadline.

Authors of selected pieces will be given a contributors copy and an honorarium of Â£10.
