<p>Gilberto Agostinho: Agostinho has composed works for several formations, from short piano pieces to orchestral works,
as well as electroacoustic pieces. The main element of his compositional technique is the use of probabilistic and generative methods to automatically generate complete pieces of music by computer programs, be they instrumental or electroacoustic. In the case of instrumental music, these computer programs output scores which are ready to be performed.</p>

<p>Emiko Artemis: Emiko Artemis is a visual artist based in Soth Australia. In her work, she explores the themes of disenfranchisement in the modern world amidst the changing conditions of contemporary life. Emiko uses symbology, ritual, and ideas of the mythical and mysticism, in her art to explore these ideas through the prism of the self and the psyche. Her post-doctoral research explores the human condition through raising questions of where boundaries of the self, psyche and the external world merge and separate.</p>

<p>Nancy Mauro-Flude: Nancy Mauro-Flude is a performing artist. Grey magics, somatic driftings and seizures of power the sensitive and subversive subterfuges by which she urges, twists and explores the aesthetic politic of the open source spirit. Systems experimentation form the basis of her work where the computer is approached as a theatre machine. Founder of Despoinas Media Coven and a home-brewed feminist server in Tasmania.

<p>Dave Everitt: From 1997 I began to combine computing with creative work at Loughborough University’s computer science department. In 2000-2002 this produced two ongoing collaborative projects, the Emergency ArtLab and cubeLife, which featured in both editions of “Explorations in Art and Technology” (Springer 2002, 2018). I’m currently an independent researcher at the Institute of Creative Technologies (De Montfort University, Leicester), lecturer in web technologies, and director of an energy data processing company working across the EU. Research interests include magic squares and cubes, the history of number symbolism, order and disorder in mathematical and natural pattern, and computer programming culture. Recent collaborations included a critique of computational creativity, and an online work “Personal Space” that matches diary entries to solar weather, from which the code in this issue is taken. I’ve delivered various presentations on being an artist working with technology, and mediated between artists and programmers. <a href="https://daveeveritt.org/art.html">https://daveeveritt.org/art.html</a></p>

<p>Fania Everitt: My academic background is in Computer Science (specialising in functional programming), and in 2009 I joined the Institute of Creative Technologies (IoCT, De Montfort University, Leicester) where I completed a PhD in “Algorithmic Meta-Creativity” in 2017; a pataphysical poetry-generating engine that was exhibited at Leicester’s Phoenix Square Gallery, presented at Computer Arts Society events, and read at literature evenings. I’ve published research on art, creativity, and technology and have a keen interest in scalable vector graphics, web development, and teaching. In 2018 I co-created the online work “Personal Space”, matching the content of an extensive text corpus of over 500 diary entries to solar weather, writing algorithms to rank the intensity of words (the code extracts are in this issue). I’m currently an independent researcher at the IoCT and a lecturer in computer science. <a href="https://fania.eu">https://fania.eu</a></p>
