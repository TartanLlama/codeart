Ania Kapuścińska: Ania is a software engineer, currently working at Thought Machine.
Loves sharing knowledge, that means both learning new things and
mentoring others. Former science educator in an astronomical club,
still can talk about stars for hours. When not sitting in front of a
computer, she is reading books and traveling as much as possible.

Gilberto Agostinho: Agostinho has composed works for several formations, from short piano pieces to orchestral works,
as well as electroacoustic pieces. The main element of his compositional technique is the use of probabilistic and generative methods to automatically generate complete pieces of music by computer programs, be they instrumental or electroacoustic. In the case of instrumental music, these computer programs output scores which are ready to be performed.

Emma Cozzani: Emma Cozzani was born in Ajaccio in 1989. Her body of research breaks down the shapes of objects of knowledge and transmissions networks, and their re-implementation at the digital era — between fiction and facts.
<p></p>
Mathieu Tremblin: Mathieu Tremblin was born in Mans in 1980. He is inspired by anonymous ways of expressions and practices, the autonomy and spontaneity found in the urban space. He plans out processus or simple and playful actions to question legal, representative and symbolic systems of the city.

Emiko Artemis: Emiko Artemis is a visual artist based in Soth Australia. In her work, she explores the themes of disenfranchisement in the modern world amidst the changing conditions of contemporary life. Emiko uses symbology, ritual, and ideas of the mythical and mysticism, in her art to explore these ideas through the prism of the self and the psyche. Her post-doctoral research explores the human condition through raising questions of where boundaries of the self, psyche and the external world merge and separate.

Juan Alberto "stage7" Martínez: Juan has been attached to a computer for most of his 32 years and now he is working as a full-time web developer while spending some spare moments as a demoscener for the one-man army project Genshiken. When he is not coding you may find him drawing, making music for old consoles or visiting some random city in his country, Spain.

Claude Heiland-Allen: Claude is an artist from London interested in the complex
emergent behaviour of simple systems, unusual geometries, and
mathematical aesthetics.  From 2005 through 2011 Claude was a member of
the GOTO10 collective, whose mission was to promote Free/Libre Open
Source Software in Art.  Since 2011 he has continued as an unaffiliated
independent artist and researcher.

Nancy Mauro-Flude: Nancy Mauro-Flude is a performing artist. Grey magics, somatic driftings and seizures of power the sensitive and subversive subterfuges by which she urges, twists and explores the aesthetic politic of the open source spirit. Systems experimentation form the basis of her work where the computer is approached as a theatre machine. Founder of Despoinas Media Coven and a home-brewed feminist server in Tasmania. Nancy leads the HCI and Aesthetics studio, School of Design, RMIT University. @sister0 | sister0.tv

Dave Everitt: From 1997 I began to combine computing with creative work at Loughborough University's computer science department. In 2000-2002 this produced two ongoing collaborative projects, the Emergency ArtLab and cubeLife, which featured in both editions of "Explorations in Art and Technology" (Springer 2002, 2018). I'm currently an independent researcher at the Institute of Creative Technologies (De Montfort University, Leicester), lecturer in web technologies, and director of an energy data processing company working across the EU. Research interests include magic squares and cubes, the history of number symbolism, order and disorder in mathematical and natural pattern, and computer programming culture. Recent collaborations included a critique of computational creativity, and an online work "Personal Space" that matches diary entries to solar weather, from which the code in this issue is taken. I've delivered various presentations on being an artist working with technology, and mediated between artists and programmers. https://daveeveritt.org/art.html

Fania Everitt: My academic background is in Computer Science (specialising in functional programming), and in 2009 I joined the Institute of Creative Technologies (IoCT, De Montfort University, Leicester) where I completed a PhD in "Algorithmic Meta-Creativity" in 2017; a pataphysical poetry-generating engine that was exhibited at Leicester's Phoenix Square Gallery, presented at Computer Arts Society events, and read at literature evenings. I've published research on art, creativity, and technology and have a keen interest in scalable vector graphics, web development, and teaching. In 2018 I co-created the online work "Personal Space", matching the content of an extensive text corpus of over 500 diary entries to solar weather, writing algorithms to rank the intensity of words (the code extracts are in this issue). I'm currently an independent researcher at the IoCT and a lecturer in computer science. https://fania.eu

Anna Carreras: Anna is a creative coder and digital artist based in Barcelona. She is interested in generative algorithms and interactive technology. She focuses her practice in code for creating visuals and installations that explore new narratives.

Ian Gibbins: Ian Gibbins is a widely-published poet, video artist and electronic musician working across diverse forms, including gallery exhibitions and commissioned public art. His videos have been shown at international festivals, having won or been short-listed for multiple awards. In his former life, Ian was an internationally recognised neuroscientist and Professor of Anatomy at Flinders University, South Australia. For details of Ian’s creative work, visit www.iangibbins.com.au.

Michael Carlisle: Michael Carlisle is a mathematician and data scientist with over a decade of professing abstraction across New York City. Their interests and work lie in probability theory, pedagogy, memory, machine learning, sequential art, notation, and comedy. PhD, City University of New York; believer in the Continuum Hypothesis; Erdős-Bacon 8.

Greg Stewart:
I live with feel, in my gut feeling,
Keeping it real, with my senses reeling,
I'm a Dalai Lama china farmer,
Knight writer in shiny karma armor!
<p></p>
Geoff Davis: Geoff is a researcher at the Creative Computing Institute, University of the Arts London (CCI, Camberwell, UAL).  Geoff founded Micro Arts Group, a computer art collective, which produced algorithmic art, short story generators and conceptual art. He has an MA in Electronic Arts from Middlesex University and a degree in Psychology, and has trained as a humanistic counsellor. A creativity app was released from the MA research. He is a published writer with a new novel due out in 2020. See http://authorgeoffdavis.com for more information and links to projects.
